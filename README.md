# Pharmacy Database Application with Python & PostgreSQL

This project implements a backend application for a pharmacy database using **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, and the **psycopg2** library. It focuses on connecting Python to a relational database, executing SQL queries, updating records, and integrating stored functions into a working application layer.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

The goal of this project is to build a practical database application interface that interacts with a pharmacy management system. It connects to a PostgreSQL database, performs key operations such as counting customers, updating order statuses, and deleting orders based on specific business logic ‚Äî all directly from Python code.

This project demonstrates core skills in:
- Database connectivity and query execution with Python.
- Writing and invoking PostgreSQL stored functions.
- Combining SQL logic with application-level operations.
- Performing real-world data manipulation (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) through Python.

## üìä Key Features

- **Customer Analytics:**  
  Count the number of unique customers for any given pharmacy using SQL queries executed through Python.

- **Order Status Updates:**  
  Dynamically update order statuses with year-based tagging and conditional logic based on provided parameters.

- **Order Deletion with Business Logic:**  
  Invoke a PostgreSQL stored function to delete future orders based on cancellation history and a configurable limit (`maxOrderDeletions`).

- **Stored Function Integration:**  
  Designed and implemented a stored function (`deleteSomeOrdersFunction`) in PostgreSQL to encapsulate complex deletion logic and return the number of deleted records.
